        <h3><strong>Option One</strong></h3>
        <h5><strong>Product Delivery:</strong></h5>
        <p>Your product will be shipped to an International Airport closest to you where Product
            Cargo is available within 1 to 3 Days (depending on the destination and current
            weight of the product) only when the final payment on your product is completed and
            confirmed.</p>
        <p>Transportation cost by Cargo is free for the following mentioned airports:
            LAX, JFK, LAS, MIA, ORD, SFO, DFW and ATL. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <p><em><strong>AT THE MOMENT DUE TO THE COVID-19 WE CAN ONLY DELIVER OUR PUPPIES
                        TO THE FOLLOWING MENTIONED AIRPORTS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE: LAX, SFO,
                        SEA, JFK, ORD AND MIA. FOR ALL OTHER AIRPORT DELIVERIES PLEASE ASK
                        FOR OUR PERSONAL INFLIGHT NANNY SERVICE.</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong><br>An in-flight nanny is required if direct Cargo flights are
                non-available to your city. The in-flight nanny cost can vary from a
                destination to another. We deliver worldwide by product nanny.</strong></p>
        <p>The Cargo has space in the plane specially designated for product. This space is
            safe, pressurized and temperature controlled. Once the flight is booked, you
            will receive a call from us and from the airline that will be transporting your
            product with full details about the shipping process and how you can pick your
            product at the airline office location. The Pet Cargo Option is the most popular
            way in delivering our puppies. All of our past puppies were delivered promptly
            and we have never experienced any accidents since we started using this delivery
            method. Unfortunately, we do NOT ship to Australia, South Africa, or India due
            to the rules and regulations on dog imports for entering these countries. We do
            not offer Cargo service outside the USA or Canada.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3><strong>Option Two</strong></h3>
        <h5><strong>Personal Delivery:</strong></h5>
        <p>The Nanny Service will require extra charges depending on the destination and it
            is necessary for all non-direct flights or for really tiny&nbsp;products(1 lb or
            less) for a safer journey. Products that are 1 lb or less can fly at anytime with
            a nanny once the export papers are ready. It is mandatory to wait until the
            product&#8217;s weight is at least 1.5 lbs to fly by cargo.</p>
        <p>One of our caring and competent nannies will take utmost care of your product from
            pick up to delivery. This service can be booked for the product to be delivered to
            any location.</p>
        <p>Delivery time depends on the availability of the in-flight nanny. Please note
            that our nannies fly on standby and the time of arrival can change without prior
            notice.</p>
        <p><strong>Express in-flight nanny delivery is available. Ask us for a
                quote.</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <h4><strong>Why does the delivery process take 1 &#8211; 3 Days ?</strong></h4>
        <p>We deliver an all-encompassing quality service. This is why the health status of
            all our products are checked by a vet that will sign and certify the product’s
            health certificate, proof of vaccination and export papers. The product&#8217;s
            weight must be at least 1.5 lbs to fly with pet cargo. We can only book the
            product’s flight once the vet has signed and certified the product’s export
            paperwork.</p>
