                your new product, you must take it to a specialist around or a friend for an
                examination.<br><br>If it is determined, within 7 days of purchase,
                that your products is clinically bad
                likely to have been damages during exportation before the date of sale and delivery, you
                have the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Return the product for a complete refund. </li>
                <li>Return the product for a replacement product of equal value.</li>
                <li>Return the product and receive reimbursement for reasonable examination fees, not
                    exceeding the purchase price.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These options do not apply where a seller, who has provided a health certificate
                issued by a veterinarian, discloses in writing at the time of sale the health
                problem for which the buyer later seeks to return the product.</p>
            <p class="w3-margin-left"><br><strong>By purchasing a product from us, you agree to the following: </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The product will be taken to the examiner promptly. You should make sure that
                    he/she is healthy and doesn’t need a vet’s attention.<br></li>
                <li>We request that this initial visit be within 48 hours of the product’s
                    arrival.This is to ensure that there aren’t problems that have arisen from
                    shipping, and also so that your veterinarian is familiar with your product if
                    a situation arises. <br></li>
                <li>We are not responsible for a product’s exposure to diseases after they are in
                    your possession. You should be careful where you take your product and who
                    handles it as well. The product should not be exposed to previously infested
                    disease areas or to places where a high level of exposure to diseases is
                    possible. <br></li>
                <li>Validation of the guarantee requires examination of your product by the expertise of
                    your choice and at your expense within 48 hours of its arrival. This
                    examination is expected to confirm that your product was healthy upon arrival.
                    <br></li>
                <li>If the product is showing any sign of defectiveness, it should be taken to the examiner
                    immediately.Your product, if shipped, has been through a proper check and has
                    received a health certificate.
                    He has also been de-wormed, but this does not mean that he/she is free of
                    worms because young animals are especially susceptible to worms, are exposed
                    every time they touch the ground, and worming is an ongoing process that
                    will need to be continued once the product is in your care. Your product will
                    also need follow up shots. It is very important that you follow up with
                    shots and de-worming. <br></li>
                <li>If the product has an expert checkup, congenital, that is a
                    life-threatening condition, bring the package with the test result of
                    defectiveness, and it will be replaced with the first available product with the same
                    value as soon as possible. The original product must be returned before a new
                    product can be delivered. <br></li>
                <li>This guarantee is null and void if the product is sold to a third party, and
                    if normal precautions aren’t taken. Especially with smaller breeds of
                    products, there is always a chance that stress will cause the product’s sugar
                    to drop to dangerous levels. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>It is the responsibility of the new owner to be very observant regarding the
                product’s sugar level, to be aware of action that needs to be taken if this
                condition does occur. The new owner should be cautious to make sure that this
                condition doesn’t affect the product, and the breeder cannot be responsible for
                issues that are a result of neglect of this condition. <br><br>The new owner is
                aware of past medical history of this product and accepts it. The new owner is
                responsible for obtaining veterinary advice when needed, and for paying for
                those services. From the time the product leaves the possession of the breeder,
                the purchaser assumes all responsibility of vet bills, and for the care of said
                product.<br><br>If for any reason the product is of no value or interest anymore,
                 the customer has the right to
                demand and order an autopsy on the product at the purchaser’s expense. If the death
                is the breeder’s fault which is found as a result of original lab results from a
                licensed veterinarian, the product will be replaced by us. <br><br>If a
                product is to be replaced, the swe will provide a healthy product of the same
                quality as the previous product as soon as one is available. The new owner will be
                responsible for all shipping charges for the first product to be returned to the
                breeder and for the charges for the second product to be shipped to them as well.
                <br><br>If the purchaser chooses not to accept a replacement product, the health
                guarantee is null and void. </p>
            <p></p>
            <blockquote class="bold">
                <p>We work closely with our producers to ensure the health of our products. They have
                    been administered all of the shots and de-wormings that are indicated on our
                    shot records. Our shots are administered by the breeder under the vet
                    recommended immunization program. We will only indicate the shots that your
                    product has had. Please be aware that they have had these shots, and continue
                    to administer shots as recommended by your veterinarian. Giving too many
                    immunizations, and ignoring the immunizations that have been given can also
                    be harmful to your product’s health. Our products will have a health
                    certificate from a licensed veterinarian before they leave, and will be vet
                    checked. </p><cite><strong><strong>Dr. Herbs ™</strong></strong></cite>
